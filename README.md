<h1> Face Detecion using OpenCV</h1>

<p> Face detection is a computer vision technology utilized to locate human face. Here, we utlized OpenCV framework which is an open source computer vision
library and was built for image processing. We import it to read and save the images. Furthermore, it is necessary for facial detection in which checks 
the differences of the intensity of the images by using a specific pre-trained classifier. It also utilized to capture video streaming. I had used the Haar feature-based Cascade Classifier to detect the face. It is an ML-based algorithm used for object and face detection. To train the model, it needs several hundred of image samples.
Then it extracts the features of the data. Cascade Classifier is utilized in image processing for face detection.</p>
